# CLAUDE.md — Mnemosyne (repo root)

Mnemosyne is a local-first app, used by Naresh (the admin) and his brother, that turns a video URL (YouTube and anything else yt-dlp supports) or an article into a timestamped transcript or a reviewed summary note for Obsidian, and quizzes you on your notes. Each person signs in with Google, has their own vault under a shared vaults folder, and sees only the modules the admin has switched on. Later it may summarise transcripts and write notes straight into an Obsidian vault. It runs on Naresh's Mac: the app in one Docker container (with a data volume and the vaults folder mounted), and whisper-server natively on the host.

This file holds only what is true everywhere. Each app has its own `CLAUDE.md` with its language, style and local rules, so read that one before working in the folder.

## Folders

| Folder | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `apps/server` | Express API: jobs, worker, yt-dlp / ffmpeg / Whisper clients, formatters; Melete services, scanner, scheduler and generator loop |
| `apps/web` | React UI (screens only), including the Melete pages and review screen |
| `apps/agent` | Python vault agent service: stateless, read-only vault tools and Claude tool-use agents; linking is its first endpoint (ADR 0042) |
| `packages/shared` | Cross-app contracts: Zod schemas and their inferred types |
| `e2e/` | End-to-end smoke test (ADR 0053): Playwright specs, local fakes (article, feed, Whisper health, Anthropic API) and a Compose override; run with `pnpm e2e` |
| `ops/` | launchd plist for the native whisper-server |
| `docs/` | Versioned plans in `docs/v<version>/` (PRD, TRD, tasks, checkpoint plans) and ADRs in `docs/decisions/`, indexed in `docs/README.md` |

## Architecture

The web app submits a URL to `POST /api/jobs`; the URL is a video (YouTube and anything else yt-dlp supports) or an article, detected from the host and overridable. The server queues a job and its worker runs it in the background, one at a time, through a source adapter that turns the job into one source document (ADR 0030). For a video, yt-dlp downloads the audio and metadata, ffmpeg converts it to 16 kHz mono WAV, and the WAV is sent over HTTP to whisper-server on the host (reached through `WHISPER_URL`); the transcript is stored as metadata plus timestamped segments, and formatters render it as Markdown (default), SRT or TXT. For an article, the server fetches the page itself, extracts the main text with Readability and stores it as Markdown (ADR 0031); a page it can't read is handled by pasting the article's text, which skips the fetch. Gmail (ADR 0035): Naresh connects his account once in Settings (read-only OAuth run by the server, the refresh token stored encrypted with a key from `.env`), adds sources that match emails by Gmail labels or a search, and the same poller reads new matching emails; each waits in the same inbox, and summarizing one converts the email's whole body to Markdown (ADRs 0036, 0040) and queues an article job whose note links back to the email, so nothing downstream knows it came from Gmail (one inbox for feed items and emails, ADR 0038; job-alert intake is deferred, ADR 0041). The worker then sends the transcript or article to Claude for a summary (title, key points, quotes, tags; article notes have no timestamps). Feeds (ADR 0032): Naresh subscribes to RSS or Atom feeds in Settings, a poller in the server process checks them on a schedule, and new items wait in the inbox on the home page; nothing is fetched or summarized until he summarizes an item (or switches a feed to summarize automatically), which turns it into a normal job. What the summary focuses on comes from a prompt profile, a named, versioned and editable guidance text that Naresh manages in Settings (the locked instructions that keep the output shape are always sent with it), and the model is chosen in Settings and can be overridden per video; both can be changed and the summary regenerated from the review screen. Every summary attempt is recorded with its model, prompt version, tokens and estimated cost. Linking (ADRs 0042–0046): when a summary completes and `AGENT_SECRET` is set, the job enters a `linking` status and the worker calls the vault agent service (`apps/agent`, reached at `AGENT_URL` with a bearer secret) with the note; the agent runs a Claude tool-use loop over read-only vault tools and returns link suggestions (existing notes, existing concepts or new concepts, each with an anchor phrase or a place under `## Related`), which the server stores per job with its own run record (model, linker prompt version, tool calls, tokens, cost). Linking never fails a job: on any error the job goes to review with a link error and can be retried. The linker prompt is a second, editable profile in Settings, with locked instructions served by the agent. In review Naresh accepts or rejects each suggestion; accepting inserts the `[[wikilink]]` into the stored draft in one transaction with the decision, so the vault is still written only by the save. The note is stored as one Markdown string, front-matter included. Naresh reviews and edits it in the web app, which autosaves it to the server as a draft (each save restarts the 24-hour expiry), and chooses a vault folder for it; saving writes the stored draft into that folder of the Obsidian vault (a mounted folder, all writes confined to it) and deletes the transcript. Jobs are stored in SQLite, and unreviewed ones expire after 24 hours without an edit. The web app polls the job's status and offers the downloads. Lifecycle (ADR 0048): every job status and allowed move is defined once in `apps/server/src/jobs/lifecycle.ts`; `moveTo` enforces it, sets expiry from the target state and logs a refused move, and the repository's status lists come from it. Logs (ADR 0049): the server (pino) and the agent write one JSON object per line, a job's ID is on every line about it and travels to the agent as `X-Job-Id`, and no secrets or note text are logged. Status (ADR 0050): every check of a feed, Gmail source, the Gmail connection, the agent, whisper-server and the backup goes through one `recordCheck` into `health_status` (the last 5 errors in `health_errors`); `GET /api/status` feeds the Status panel on the Settings → Sources tab and the warning badge on the drawer's Settings item. Backups (ADR 0051): **Back up now** (`POST /api/backups`) writes a consistent copy of the database to the host folder mounted at `/backups` (the app container only, never the agent), nothing deletes it, the encryption key is never written there, and the server refuses to start on a database from a newer version. Settings (ADR 0052) is routed tabs, Prompts / Models / Sources, under a data router with one unsaved-changes guard. Melete (ADRs 0054–0060) is a second module of the same server, web app and database: the user picks a learning root in the vault, each folder in it is a subject, and a scan (on demand, 30-second rule, no watcher) tracks notes by path and a body hash so moves keep their history (ADR 0057). Enrolled notes are queued in `melete_notes` and a generator loop beside the worker asks Claude for recall questions in one call from Express, not the agent (ADRs 0055, 0058); questions are scheduled with FSRS through `ts-fsrs` at 90% target recall (ADR 0056). In review, typed answers are graded by a second Claude call that suggests a rating, or the user rates in quick mode; the rating updates the card and writes a review row in one transaction. **Melete never writes to the vault**; it reads it and keeps all its data in the `melete_*` tables, and its two prompts are profiles in Settings with a `purpose`. The seeded Study summary profile and folder memory (the picker starts on the last folder used with the job's profile, `Job.default_folder`) are ADR 0059. The app port is published on `127.0.0.1` only; phone access is Tailscale Serve (documented in `docs/phone-access.md`, not coded), with a web app manifest and no service worker (ADR 0060).

The reasons behind each part are in `docs/decisions/`. Read the ADRs a task lists before starting.

## Workflow

Work is planned in versioned docs: `docs/v<version>/prd.md` (what and why), `trd.md` (how) and `tasks.md` (ordered tasks grouped into checkpoints). The current version is **0.9.0**. Only Naresh edits the PRD and TRD; `tasks.md` is the only planning doc you edit, and you also write ADRs and checkpoint plans.

At the start of every session:
1. Read `docs/v0.9.0/prd.md`, `trd.md` and `tasks.md`, and the ADRs listed against the next unticked task.
2. Say which checkpoint and task is next, in one line.
3. If that checkpoint's Plan cell is ⬜: enter plan mode and write one plan for every task in the checkpoint (files to touch, tests to write first, expected red → green path). Stop. When Naresh approves it, save it to `docs/v0.9.0/plans/checkpoint-<x>.md`, tick the Plan cell, commit, push, then start the first task.
4. If the Plan cell is ✅: read the saved plan and continue from the first unticked task.

Within a checkpoint, work through its tasks without stopping. For each task: failing tests first and watch them fail → least code to pass → refactor while green → tick Status and add a log line in `tasks.md` → commit → push. At the end of the checkpoint, stop and report (see "Before you stop").

If something isn't covered by the PRD, TRD, ADRs or the approved plan (a new dependency, endpoint, job status, contract change or folder), stop and ask. When Naresh decides, write the next-numbered ADR, add it to `docs/README.md` and to the task's ADR column, then continue.

## Precedence

1. An ADR listed in `tasks.md` overrides the TRD where they conflict, until Naresh updates the TRD. Mention it in the checkpoint report (e.g. "ADR 0019 changes TRD §8").
2. The TRD and ADRs override any `CLAUDE.md` description of the current architecture. When a task changes something a `CLAUDE.md` describes, update that `CLAUDE.md` in the same commit.
3. Any other conflict, or a doc that looks wrong: stop and ask. Don't pick one, and never edit the PRD or TRD.

## Rules that span apps

- **TDD, always.** Write the failing test first, run it and watch it fail for the right reason, write the least code that passes, then refactor while green. Each app's `CLAUDE.md` says how this runs there.
- **Contracts live in `packages/shared`** as Zod schemas, imported by package name (`@mnemosyne/shared`). Neither app redefines a shape the other one uses. One exception (ADR 0043): the agent service's contract is Pydantic-first (`apps/agent/src/mnemosyne_agent/contract/`), mirrored by hand in `packages/shared/src/agent.ts`, and a contract change is one commit covering the models, the committed JSON Schema export, the golden examples and the Zod mirror.
- **The server never spawns Whisper.** It calls whisper-server over HTTP at `WHISPER_URL`.
- **The stored transcript is the source of truth.** Markdown, SRT and TXT are rendered from it by pure formatters; Markdown is never stored as the canonical data.
- **No secrets in the repo.** Environment files stay out of git; `.env.example` lists the variable names only.
- **Don't add a dependency** unless the TRD or an ADR names it. Ask instead.

## Git

- Work on `main`. One commit per task, containing its code, tests and the `tasks.md` update. Push after every commit.
- Conventional messages scoped by version and task id, so every scope is unique across versions: `feat(0.9-3.2): Claude client`, `refactor(0.9-6.1): useJob on TanStack Query`, `docs(0.9-plan): checkpoint B`. Use major.minor for the version (`0.9`), and the full version for a patch release (`0.7.1-2.3`).
- Stage files by name; never `git add -A` or `git add .`. Never commit `.env` or anything with a secret.
- Never `--amend`, rebase, force-push, `reset`, `stash`, `checkout -- <file>` or `restore`. If a commit is wrong, fix it in a new commit.
- If a push fails, stop and report it; don't try to resolve it.

## Before you stop

After each task, run the tests, lint and typecheck for every folder it touched; a task isn't ticked until all of them pass. At the end of every checkpoint from F on, also run `pnpm e2e` (it builds the Compose stack against local fakes and tears it down; needs Docker running). At the end of a checkpoint, report:
- what was built, task by task, with commit hashes;
- test, lint and typecheck results per folder, and the `pnpm e2e` result;
- any ADRs written and whether they change the TRD;
- anything deferred or worth a follow-up.
