# Google Cloud setup

Mnemosyne uses one Google OAuth client for two things (ADR 0061): **signing in** (everyone, with `openid email profile`) and **reading Gmail** (optional, per person, read-only with `gmail.readonly`). The setup is done once, in the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). The console's menus change from time to time; the names below are those of the Google Auth Platform at the time of writing, so if one no longer matches, trust Google's own help.

Nothing is stored at Google beyond the client itself. Mnemosyne never changes a mailbox.

## 1. Create the client

1. **Create a project** (any name, for example Mnemosyne).
2. **Enable the Gmail API:** APIs & Services → Library → Gmail API → Enable. (Sign-in alone doesn't need it; skip this if nobody will connect Gmail.)
3. **Branding:** Google Auth Platform → Branding. Give the app a name and your email as the support and developer contact. Google asks for a homepage and a privacy policy link; any page you control will do (this is a personal app).
4. **Audience:** choose **External**.
5. **Data Access:** add the scopes `openid`, `.../auth/userinfo.email` and `.../auth/userinfo.profile` (shown as `openid email profile`), and, if anyone will connect Gmail, `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`.
6. **Clients → Create client → Web application.** Add the authorized redirect URIs listed in [step 2](#2-authorized-redirect-uris). Copy the client ID and client secret.

## 2. Authorized redirect URIs

Every address in `APP_ORIGINS` needs **two** redirect URIs in the client, one for sign-in and one for Gmail. They must match character for character, including `http` or `https` and the port. For these origins:

| Origin | Used for | Sign-in redirect URI | Gmail redirect URI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `http://localhost:3100` | the Mac, Docker | `http://localhost:3100/api/auth/callback` | `http://localhost:3100/api/gmail/oauth/callback` |
| `http://localhost:5173` | development (`pnpm dev`) | `http://localhost:5173/api/auth/callback` | `http://localhost:5173/api/gmail/oauth/callback` |
| `https://<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net` | phones and other people, over Tailscale ([`phone-access.md`](phone-access.md)) | `https://<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net/api/auth/callback` | `https://<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net/api/gmail/oauth/callback` |

Google accepts `http` only for `localhost`; any other address must be `https`. The Tailscale address is the one `tailscale serve` prints.

The app builds the redirect URI from the address the browser used, and refuses an address that isn't in `APP_ORIGINS` (a 400 saying so). Adding a new address therefore takes two steps: add it to `APP_ORIGINS` in `.env` and restart, and add its two redirect URIs here.

## 3. Who can sign in

Only people the admin has added in **Settings → Admin** (and the account named by `ADMIN_EMAIL`, on the first sign-in). Google decides who can *reach* the consent screen; Mnemosyne decides who is *let in*. A Google account that isn't on the list sees a plain "not allowed" page.

How you set the **Audience** matters for the first part:

- **In production** (recommended): anyone with a Google account can reach the consent screen, and Google shows an "unverified app" warning that you continue past; you don't need to submit the app for verification. Refresh tokens don't expire, which Gmail needs.
- **Testing:** only the Google accounts listed as **test users** can sign in at all, so add every person you add in Admin (including yourself). **Gmail breaks every 7 days in this mode**: Google expires refresh tokens of apps in Testing after a week, and Gmail shows **Reconnect needed**. Publish the app (Audience → **Publish app**) if anyone uses Gmail.

## 4. `.env`

Put the values in `.env` (the repo root for Docker, `apps/server/.env` for development):

```sh
ADMIN_EMAIL=you@gmail.com
APP_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3100,https://<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY=...   # from: openssl rand -base64 32
```

`TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` encrypts the stored Gmail refresh tokens and signs the short-lived sign-in cookie. Keep it as safe as the secret: a copy of the database is useless without it, and a lost or changed key means everyone has to reconnect Gmail. The server won't start without the Google variables, `ADMIN_EMAIL` or `APP_ORIGINS`.

`GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`, which earlier versions used, is no longer read; a leftover value is ignored and logged as a warning.

## 5. Check it

Restart (`docker compose up -d`), open the app and press **Sign in with Google** with the `ADMIN_EMAIL` account. You land in the app (after choosing a vault, the first time). Then, in **Settings → Sources**, **Connect Gmail** sends you through Google again for the read-only access.

- **"Error 400: redirect_uri_mismatch"**: the redirect URI the app sent isn't in the client's list. Check the address in the browser's bar against the table above.
- **"Access blocked: Mnemosyne has not completed the Google verification process"** or "This app is blocked": the app is in *Testing* and this Google account isn't a test user; add it, or publish the app.
- **"This address isn't configured in APP_ORIGINS"**: add the address to `APP_ORIGINS` and restart.
- **Sign-in lands on the "not allowed" page**: the email isn't in the Admin tab (or isn't verified at Google).
